  - if the BBC tag has a value, e.g. `[color=]`, the cursor will go after the `=`
- inserts `[url=][/url]` when pasting a link into a BBCode input
- fix bbcode links sometimes being broken
- render bbcode url as text when there is no text
  - e.g. `[url=https://example.com][/url]` will show as `https://example.com`
- improved bbcode link styling - fixes awkward wrapping and icon alignment
- the bbcode preview is now more accurate, and reflects _exactly_ what your message will look like, e.g. with /me
- bbcode preview doesn't cover stuff up anymore üëè
